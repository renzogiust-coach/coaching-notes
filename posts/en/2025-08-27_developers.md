Today I want to speak to #developers.  
  
In the first part of my journey, I was one of you. I developed applications for years, so I know very well what it means: exciting projects, constant challenges, tensions to manage, moments of euphoria… and yes, even a few sleepless nights (I still remember one with Roberto, many years ago, wrestling with a Magento instance—but that wasn’t the only one).  
  
I know how engaging and stimulating this work can be, but also how *demanding* it gets: technological evolution waits for no one. Every day you deal with tight deadlines, implementation complexities, unclear requirements, quality assurance, constant updates, new languages, frameworks, architectures, infrastructures, best practices… not to mention the challenge of explaining this complexity to clients, suppliers, or colleagues.  
  
And today, with the rise of #AI, everything is accelerating even more, and it can really feel like things are spiraling out of control... :)  
  
From my personal experience, I’ve learned that these challenges—and, really, all of life’s challenges—can be faced in two ways:

- ✅ Actively: feeling in charge, centered, and proactive.
- ❌ Reactively: letting events take over and simply responding to them.

  
Today, as a #coach but also as someone who still lives and breathes #technology every day, I choose to stand beside developers who feel the need for #change: a step forward, a change of pace, or even a completely different direction. Even—and especially—when it seems like the conditions aren’t there.  
  
If you too feel it’s time to take action, but struggle to find the right conditions to do so, feel free to send me a message.
