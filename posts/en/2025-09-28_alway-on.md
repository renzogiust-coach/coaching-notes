If you work in digital, there’s no way around it.  
Digital is always on. Servers are always on. Competition, opportunities, problems… everything is always on.  
Everything is (or seems) important. Very important. The pace is relentless.

And you, an analog human, how do you feel in this race with no pause button?

Some feel alive, fueled by the adrenaline of being “constantly on edge.”  
And others... don’t.

Some feel overwhelmed, because they know they’re not machines and yet feel forced into this race.  
Because sometimes the body reminds them: the body speaks, but often it isn’t listened to—until it forces us to stop.  
Thinking about this, a poem by Kahlil Gibran comes to mind:
> Before my soul counseled me, I doubted the value of my work.
Now I realize that trees blossom in Spring and bear fruit in Summer without seeking praise; and their leaves fall in Autumn and their branches are bare in Winter without fearing blame.

Flowers in spring and fruits in summer represent creativity and productivity.  
Falling leaves and bare branches, instead, remind us of moments of pause, silence, apparent emptiness: they too have dignity and meaning, without shame or criticism.

Every season has its role.  
From this awareness I’ve come to understand that true maturity—for me—is not living permanently always on, but in harmony with my own nature.  
(If your nature is always on, then that’s fine too!)

👉 And you?  
How do you live the tension between your humanity and the always on world?  
Which signals from your body do you tend to ignore?  
What would help you find a rhythm more in tune with yourself?
