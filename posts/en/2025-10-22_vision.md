Vision from Above

Today I want to share a recent experience — not as a coach, but as a coachee (client).
During the session, my goal was to focus on the most important actions to put in place between now and the end of the year.

Focusing on what truly matters is a common challenge for many — founders, freelancers, CxOs, managers — but in reality, it’s useful for anyone who wants to regain direction and clarity.
In daily operations, between speed, unexpected events, and constant decisions, we sometimes lose the ability to see the big picture.

The metaphor that emerged during the session was that of finding myself in the middle of a crowd: people near and far representing all my ongoing activities, relationships, and challenges.
From that point of view, visibility was limited — I could only see a few heads in front of me. Even when jumping for a moment, I could catch a glimpse of the direction, but quickly lost it again.
A rather unpleasant feeling — a sense of losing control.

Metaphorically, I needed a ladder to climb up and look at myself from above, to observe the path I’ve walked over the past year and a half.
That session became my ladder: it allowed me to regain perspective, reconnect with my values, clarify priorities, and understand how to challenge myself to achieve the results I want.

By my side was a coach who, through active listening, presence, and powerful questions, helped me reach the depth I needed to look from above. 🦅

Focus. Clarity. Values. Future.

If these words resonate with you, reach out — even just for a chat.
