Coaching, for those who have experienced it, is a powerful opportunity for growth, evolution, and transformation.

As I wrote in another post, besides the sessions I hold as a coach, every week I also book at least one session "as a client".

Why?
Because growth and transformation are not isolated events. They are an ongoing process, built day after day.

I like to think of this process through what many call the 1% Effect (or Marginal Gains), which can be represented mathematically as:
1.01³⁶⁵ ≈ 37.78

The idea is simple: by improving just 1% every day, for a whole year, each small step multiplies, leading to a huge transformation. By the end of the year, you’d be nearly 38 times ahead of where you started. Not twice, not three times, 38 times.

But beyond the numbers, the real point is this: tiny daily improvements, when done consistently, create extraordinary results.

That’s what coaching is for me (at least in part): the tool that helps me work on those steps which, over time, are not so small after all.

Every week in session I bring a topic, the hot topic of the moment. It could be a situation I’m facing, a thought that won’t leave me, an intuition, an idea, a concern, a challenge.
With coaching, I find my answers, working on clarity and direction.
Some topics get resolved in one session, others take much more time, and some keep coming back (like my relationship with my smartphone 😬).

And if I return to the word I began with, it’s this: opportunity.

👉 Personal opportunity: to find clarity, new answers, new directions.

👉 Organizational opportunity: because when people grow, organizations grow too.

Coaching, in any context, simply rocks. (Well, I admit I’m biased 😃)
