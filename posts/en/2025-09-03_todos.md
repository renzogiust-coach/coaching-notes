Anyone who knows me knows I enjoy experimenting with apps to manage my TODOs and notes. For a few years now, I’ve been using Akiflow, but today I want to share something different. 😀  
  
For me, September has always felt like a kind of personal New Year: after a lighter August, activities pick up again and comes the awareness that the year is heading into its final stretch—together with that feeling of “time is short, I need to give my best”.  
  
That’s why two days ago (Monday, September 1st, 7:15 a.m. 😬😅), during a coaching session where I was the client, I decided to bring a specific topic: defining a list of TODOs and NOT TODOs for the month ahead.  
I tried this approach last month and found it really supportive.  
  
How does it work?  
I define a few crucial actions (5–8): the most important things to do and not to do.  
  
Why does it help me?  
👉 It reduces anxiety: giving a concrete name to priorities (and to distractions to avoid) takes power away from anxiety, which thrives on lack of clarity.  
👉 It motivates me: in those few lines I see the best version of myself. It’s like in video games, when you race against the “ghost” of your best lap time—that ideal pushes you to do better.  
👉 It keeps me accountable and serves as a reminder: after writing (and printing, in my case) the actions on paper, I hang the sheet in a visible place; this way I’m reminded of these “rules” and can check how close or far I am from them.  
👉 It keeps me accountable even more: in my case, the sheet is on the kitchen board, visible to my family. It’s an invitation to be transparent and consistent, with their support in this “challenge”.  
  
That coaching session was the magnifying glass that helped me focus on what I already knew deep inside, and the filter that allowed me to clear out the background noise.  
  
And you? Do you have a small (or big) practice to start the month with clarity?
