One of the themes that often comes up in coaching sessions is the search for clarity, a need that can emerge in many areas: work, relationships, or one’s personal life.

When I think of “clarity,” words like action, determination, motivation, achievement, growth immediately come to mind.

But when I think of “lack of clarity,” uuuuuuu 😅, here’s what shows up: waiting, mental loops, uncertainty, vicious circles, procrastination, anxiety, confusion.

In my experience, both as a coach and as a coachee, coaching has proven to be a powerful tool for working on this very theme: it offers a safe space where you can slow down, look within without judgment, and recognize what truly matters—while letting go of the rest.
